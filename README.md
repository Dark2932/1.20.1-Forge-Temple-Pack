# 1.20.1-Forge-Basic-pack
This basic modpack is created for me to develop modpack or server.

Of course, you could use this template repository.

If you have any questions, please create a issue.

What's more, the development environment is based on [PrismLaucher](https://prismlauncher.org/).

## Usage
1. Click `Use this template` to create a new repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local instance folder.
3. Launch the game in PrismLauncher.
